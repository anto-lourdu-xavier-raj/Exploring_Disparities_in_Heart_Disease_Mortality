# As part of my Statistical Programming coursework at Grand Valley State University, I recently finished a thorough research on "Exploring Disparities in Heart Disease Mortality: An Analysis of Gender and Ethnicity Across US States". The goal of the study was to determine differences in heart disease mortality rates between US states according to race, ethnicity, and gender. Through the use of sophisticated statistical techniques to compile, clean, and analyze large datasets, we discovered notable differences in the death rates between various demographic groups. These understandings are essential for developing focused healthcare interventions and policies meant to lessen disparities in cardiovascular health. My knowledge of statistical analysis, data administration, and health disparities research has improved as a result of this study.
