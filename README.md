# Exploring Disparities in Heart Disease Mortality

This project analyzes disparities in heart disease mortality rates across U.S. states, focusing on gender, race, and ethnicity. Using advanced statistical techniques, large datasets were cleaned, compiled, and analyzed to uncover significant differences in mortality rates among demographic groups. The findings emphasize the importance of targeted healthcare policies and interventions to reduce cardiovascular health disparities. This project demonstrates expertise in statistical analysis, data management, and health disparities research.
